Brain Tumor Detection and Classification Using Continual Learning
This repository contains a project focused on the continual learning-based detection and classification of brain tumors using a deep learning model. The system classifies tumors into different categories 
(such as glioma, pituitary, and meningioma) and supports incremental learning to incorporate new tumor classes or data over time without losing previously acquired knowledge.


Project Overview
Brain tumors are life-threatening conditions that require accurate and timely detection For effective treatment.
Conventional machine learning models often struggle to maintain their performance when new data or tumor classes are introduced, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting.
This project leverages continual learning strategies to develop a robust brain tumor detection and classification system that can be incrementally updated as new data becomes available.

Features
Multi-Class Classification: The model is designed to classify different types of brain tumors, including glioma, pituitary, and meningioma.
Continual Learning: Supports learning new tumor classes and updating the model without retraining from scratch, minimizing data loss and preserving existing knowledge.
Replay Buffer Strategy: Integrates a replay buffer to maintain a small subset of the previously learned classes While learning new data.
Preprocessing and Data Augmentation: Includes pre-processing and augmentation steps to ensure the model is robust and generalized.
Dataset
The dataset used For this project includes MRI images categorized into four classes: glioma, pituitary, meningioma, and notumor. The images are preprocessed, resized to 64x64 pixels, and normalized before training.

You can download the dataset from the Kaggle Brain Tumor Dataset.

Model Architecture
The deep learning model For this project is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which consists of the following layers:

Input Layer: Takes images of size (64, 64, 3).
Convolutional Layers: Three convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max pooling.
Flatten Layer: Converts the 2D matrix data to a 1D vector.
Dense Layers: Two dense layers with ReLU and softmax activations For multi-class classification.
Continual Learning Approach
The project employs a continual learning methodology using the following strategies:

Replay Buffer: Stores a subset of previously learned data, ensuring that when the model is updated with new classes, it does not forget prior knowledge.
Incremental Training: Integrates new data and labels While preserving older classes, allowing the model to adapt over time without retraining from scratch.
