Project Summary: Customer Classification Using Categorical Data
This project involves classifying customers using a dataset with categorical features. The main tasks include loading the dataset, splitting it into training and test sets,
and applying encoding to categorical data to prepare it for machine learning models.

Key steps:

Data Preprocessing: The data is split into features (X) and labels (Y), and then divided into training and test sets.
Encoding:
OrdinalEncoder is used to convert categorical features (e.g., customer type, education level) into numerical values.
LabelEncoder is applied to the target variable (customer classification).
The encoded data will be ready for use in machine learning models to predict customer classes.
